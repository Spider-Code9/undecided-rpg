# Undecided RPG

I just had an idea (more like a desire) of creating a terminal based RPG game, like a MUD or something - and I sketched this out in like half an hour or so. I don't know what the classes will be or what the skills will be, but I am thinking of a rotation based mechanic, what you generally see in MMOs with a community based economy system. There's a lot of stuff to figure out. I am also thinking of a possible crafting and gathering mechanic which doesn't suck. At this point, my mind is flooding with random stuff which I can add or build. If I take this endeavour, this would a long run â€” how does it look tho?

Goes without saying, nothing is finalised. The design, UI, skills, classes, currencies, or anything else for that matter.

Also, if you have any ideas or suggestions, let me know. And if you would like to help build it, even better... I love free labour in the name of open source!

I am posting a link to a discord server I created. If you would like to provide ideas with storyline, world building, lore, classes, game mechanics, or anything, and play the game itself in the future, join us. Also note that this is a PC game, so a computer is required to play. The game is command line based so it doesn't requires any graphics to run. All computers would be able to run it.
